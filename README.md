# Defcon-Malware-Contest
My sample for the malware contest by CyCraft at Defcon 32, didn't have time to finish it during the competition but here's the would be final product

Features:

  Dynamic syscall resolving
  
  Using NT functions (via direct syscalls) whenever possible
  
  String obfuscation (mostly) and AV sandbox evasion
  
  Using manual implimentations of functions to further avoid imports and function hooking
  
Downsides:

  Nothing to prevent against finding malware from the event viewer (which since this was a malware vs EDR competition over a couple days most EDR solutions utilized the event viewer a ton)
  
  Using windows sqlite3 library, not too big of a deal but if there was time I would have liked to make a manual implimentation to avoid importing nonstandard dlls as well as to have the entirety 
of challenge two utilize only three WinAPI functions (NtCreateFile, NtReadFile, NtClose) instead of everything needed for winsqlite
  
  winsqlite, winhttp, and bcrypt functions aren't dynamically resolved so they show up in the import table, likely not a huge deal for winsqlite or winhttp but it would have been nice to dynamically resolve bcrypt

Overall this was a super fun challenge expecially since I've never messed with bcrypt winsqlite or winhttp which ended up being a huge learning opprotunity!
